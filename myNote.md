Notes: 
- Whenever we have index files, we don't need to specify index in the import line, we can just say the folder name and it automatically search for the index file.
- componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree)
    - Mounting is the process of outputting the virtual representation of a component into the final UI representation (e.g. DOM or Native Components). In a browser that would mean outputting a React Element into an actual DOM element (e.g. an HTML div or li element) in the DOM tree.
- What is Hooks?
 - It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.
 - useState, useEffect
- In CSS for material UI element we need to includ the !important keyword on margin
