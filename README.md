# Covid19TrackerApp
[Live Site](https://covid-19-apptracker.herokuapp.com/)

The APIs I used: 
- https://covid19.mathdro.id/api
- https://disease.sh/

This is a COVID-19 Tracker/Stats Application personal project. Where I built using React with the addition of Charts.js, Material UI, and many different modules. Throughout the process I learned about the usage of Material UI, Charts.js, React Hooks, API data fetching, all of it in React JS.
